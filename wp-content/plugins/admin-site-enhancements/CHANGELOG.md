* **[IMPROVED in Pro] Content Management >> Media Categories**: css adjustment to fix toolbar items spilling over to the second line in the grid view on certain scenarios.

It was previously showing 500 error when a site is inspected with [Sucuri malware and security checker](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/). The code changes for this was produced by ChatGTP via [@ofmarconi](https://wordpress.org/support/users/ofmarconi/)'s [prompt](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sucuri-error-500-disable-feed/#post-16957833) as part of his [detailed report and investigation](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sucuri-error-500-disable-feed/) on the issue.

### 5.5.1 (2023.08.07)
